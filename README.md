# Wrestling-Simulator


Each wrestler will be assigned random values such as height, weight, ability, fighting style, and identification. There will be a total of 3 teams each with about 12 wrestlers and they are competing in a one and done tournament. The wrestler's height, weight, and fighting style will determine their advantage against the other wrestlers. If a wrester loses then they are moved on to the loser's bracket where they can still compete against the other losers but will only be able to score half the points than someone in the winner's bracket. At the end of the tournament, whoever is the last one standing in the winner's bracket will win MVP and the team with the most points will win the overall tournament.
